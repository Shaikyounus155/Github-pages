## 🧰 **Full Explanation of Tools Used**

---

### 🔧 **1. GitHub**

#### 💡 What is GitHub?
GitHub is a **website** where you can **store your code** and **collaborate with others**. Think of it as a cloud-based folder for your projects, but built specifically for code.

#### 🌍 Why use it?
- It keeps all your code in one place.
- You can **track changes**, go back to previous versions, and work with teammates.
- It also connects directly to **GitHub Pages**, which lets you host websites for free.

#### 🔗 Example:
When you create a repository (repo) like `my-static-site`, GitHub stores your HTML files and lets you access them from anywhere.

---

### 💻 **2. Git**

#### 💡 What is Git?
Git is a **version control tool** used in the **command line** (terminal). It tracks changes in your code over time — like saving versions of a file every time you work on it.

#### ⚙️ What it does:
- Saves **snapshots** of your project at different times.
- Lets you go back to earlier versions if something breaks.
- Works hand-in-hand with GitHub to upload your code online.

#### 🔧 Common Git Commands:
| Command                   | What It Does                                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `git init`                | Starts a new Git project                         |
| `git add .`               | Adds all files to be tracked                     |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Saves a snapshot with a short message            |
| `git push`                | Sends your files to GitHub                       |

### 🌐 **3. GitHub Pages**

#### 💡 What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a **free hosting service** by GitHub that lets you turn your project into a live website.

#### 🚀 What it can do:
- Host any **static content** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- No server or backend needed — it’s perfect for portfolios, documentation, or basic sites.
- You just upload your files, and GitHub gives you a **live link** to share with anyone.

#### 🧪 How it works:
1. Create a repository and upload your `index.html`.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo's **Settings → Pages**.
3. Choose the `main` branch and root folder.
4. GitHub generates a **website link** like:
   ```
   
   ```
